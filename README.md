# 🚀 Deep Learning Model with VGG16 on CIFAR-10 🎯

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a deep learning model leveraging a pre-trained **VGG16** architecture for **image classification** on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. The model is fine-tuned and trained using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to enhance classification performance. 🧠✨

## 📂 Dataset 📊
The **CIFAR-10** dataset consists of **60,000** 32x32 color images across **10 distinct classes**, with **6,000 images per class**. The dataset is efficiently loaded using `tensorflow_datasets` and preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the **VGG16** input size (**150x150**). 🖼📈

### 🏷 Classes:
1️⃣ ✈️ Airplane  
2️⃣ 🚗 Automobile  
3️⃣ 🐦 Bird  
4️⃣ 🐱 Cat  
5️⃣ 🦌 Deer  
6️⃣ 🐶 Dog  
7️⃣ 🐸 Frog  
8️⃣ 🏠 Horse  
9️⃣ 🚢 Ship  
🔟 🚚 Truck  

## ⚙ Installation 🛠️
Ensure you have **Python** installed, then install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib tensorflow-datasets
```

## 🏗 Model Architecture 🧠
- ✅ Utilizes the **pre-trained VGG16** model as a feature extractor.
- 🔗 Incorporates **fully connected layers** for classification refinement.
- 📏 **Input images** are resized to **150x150** to align with VGG16 requirements.

### 🔹 View Results 📊
Performance metrics such as **accuracy** and **loss** are visualized using **Matplotlib** 📉📈.
